Caregiver is an event logger for users with babies. Events logged are feedings, and diaper changes. What sets this concept apart is the use of mutiple users providing care for the
same child. Just born babies need extra care and attention to ensure they are healthy when they are born. The tracker is meant to help a parent who may be lacking sleep to better
care for their child with the help of this application. Other users like a relative, friend, babysitter and daycare professional can help log events for the parent when the baby 
is in their care.
